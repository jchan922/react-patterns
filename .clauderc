# Claude Code Configuration for React Patterns Project

## Project Context

You are working in the React Patterns repository - a version-tracked learning resource demonstrating React patterns across different major versions.

**IMPORTANT:** Before working on any task, read `/specs/project-spec.md` for complete project context, architecture principles, version isolation rules, and maintenance guidelines.

## Quick Reference

- **Master Spec:** `/specs/project-spec.md` - Read this first!
- **React 19 Standards:** `/react-19/coding-standards.md` - Current active version
- **Key Principle:** Each React version folder is completely isolated and independent

## Version-Specific Work

When working on code or documentation:
1. Identify which React version folder you're in (react-19/, react-20/, etc.)
2. Read that version's `coding-standards.md`
3. Follow that version's patterns - don't mix patterns across versions

**All detailed specifications are in `/specs/project-spec.md` - always consult it for context!**
